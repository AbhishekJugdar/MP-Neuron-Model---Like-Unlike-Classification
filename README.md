Machine learning using the basic MP Neuron model to classify mobile phones according to their features.

This code is based on the MP Neuron model which was used for the binary classification of mobile phones based on various features such as price, screen size, RAM, processor frequency, etc. Code was created for a Kaggle Competition in which it achieved 85.7% accuracy on the public dataset and 71.4% accuracy on the privte dataset.
